OpenBSP is designed for both individual businesses and service providers. You
can use it to manage your own WhatsApp messaging, or leverage its features to
become a
[Meta Business Partner](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/solution-providers)
and offer WhatsApp messaging services to other organizations.

## User Interface

For a complete web-based interface to manage conversations check out the
companion project:

**🖥️ [OpenBSP UI](https://github.com/matiasbattocchia/open-bsp-ui)** — A modern,
responsive web interface built with React and Tailwind.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ef30dde-9de1-4f5a-856a-db34ca2e3063

## Description

OpenBSP API is a multi-tenant platform that connects to the official WhatsApp
API to receive and send messages, storing them in a Supabase-backed database.

### Core features

- 🤝 **Meta Business Partner ready**: Built to facilitate the transition to an
  official solution provider.
- 🔗 **WhatsApp account Coexistence**: Connect existing WhatsApp Business
  accounts via
  [Embedded Signup](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/embedded-signup/onboarding-business-app-users).
- 🏢 **Multi-tenant architecture**: Native support for multiple organizations
  with isolated environments.
- 🔌 **External integration**: Seamlessly connect with external services using
  webhooks and the API.

### AI agents

Create lightweight agents or connect to external, more advanced agents using
different protocols like `a2a` and `chat-completions`. Lightweight agents can
use built-in tools:

- MCP client
- SQL client
- HTTP client
- Calculator

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project prioritizes a decoupled architecture between communication and
> agent logic. Advanced agents built with frameworks like the OpenAI SDK or
> Google ADK should be deployed as external services.

### Media processing

Interpret and extract information from media and document files, including:

- Audio
- Images
- Video
- PDF
- Other text-based documents (CSV, HTML, TXT, etc.)

### Claude Code plugin

The OpenBSP plugin gives Claude Code full API access and optionally bridges
WhatsApp messages in real-time. Claude can query contacts, conversations,
templates, and more via the `query` tool, and reply to WhatsApp messages via the
`reply` tool.

Install the plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add matiasbattocchia/open-bsp-api
/plugin install openbsp@matiasbattocchia-open-bsp-api
```

On first run, a browser opens for Google sign-in (same account as the web UI).
Then configure allowed contacts for the WhatsApp channel:

```
/openbsp:config contacts add 5491155551234
```

No contacts are forwarded until explicitly added (secure by default). API access
works regardless of channel configuration. See
[`plugin/README.md`](plugin/README.md) for full documentation.

### MCP server

The `mcp` Edge Function exposes an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server
over SSE, giving agentic access to the WhatsApp API from clients like Claude
Desktop or other agent platforms.

For the hosted version at [web.openbsp.dev](https://web.openbsp.dev), the MCP
server URL is:

```
https://nheelwshzbgenpavwhcy.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp
```

Authentication uses the `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` header. Get it from
OpenBSP > Settings > API Keys.

Optionally, `Allowed-Contacts` and `Allowed-Accounts` headers restrict which
phone numbers the key can access.

Claude Desktop configuration (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openbsp": {
      "url": "https://nheelwshzbgenpavwhcy.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <API_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Available tools:

| Tool                 | Description                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_accounts`      | List connected WhatsApp accounts                              |
| `list_conversations` | Get recent active conversations                               |
| `fetch_conversation` | Fetch messages and service window status for a contact        |
| `search_contacts`    | Find contacts by name or phone number                         |
| `send_message`       | Send a text or template message (enforces 24h service window) |
| `list_templates`     | List available WhatsApp templates                             |
| `fetch_template`     | Fetch details of a specific template                          |

## Demo

A managed instance is available at
**[web.openbsp.dev](https://web.openbsp.dev)** — same codebase as this repo,
running on Supabase. Sign up with a Google or GitHub account.

### Quotas

| Resource      | Included         |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Messages      | 5,000 / month    |
| Conversations | Unlimited        |
| Storage       | 1 GB             |
| AI Credits    | $1.00 (one-time) |

AI Credits apply only when agents use the built-in LLM gateway. Configuring an
agent with your own provider API key (`AgentExtra.api_key`) bypasses credit
consumption.

### Data portability

Your data is yours. You can export your organization's data from the hosted
instance and load it into a self-hosted deployment — both run the same schema,
and all data is scoped by organization with no cross-org dependencies.

## Self-host deployment

> [!NOTE]
> **Deploy your own instance in under 15 minutes** — no local environment
> required.

1. [Fork](https://github.com/matiasbattocchia/open-bsp-api/fork) this repo (1
   min)
2. Create a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project (5 min)
3. Connect the project to your fork via the Supabase GitHub Integration (5 min)

You are live! 🚀 Pushes to your default branch will automatically deploy
database migrations and Edge Functions.

#### Connect via Supabase GitHub Integration

In the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard):

1. Go to **Project Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Under **GitHub Integration**, click **Authorize GitHub**
3. On the GitHub authorization page, click **Authorize Supabase**
4. Back on the Integrations page, choose your forked **open-bsp-api** repository
5. Set the **Working directory** to `.` (the `supabase/` folder lives at the
   repo root)
6. Set the **Production branch** to `main`
7. Configure the remaining options as needed
8. Click **Enable integration**

<details>
<summary>
Alternative: deploy via GitHub Actions (optional)
</summary>

The repository also ships with a `Release` GitHub Actions workflow that performs
the same deployment from inside CI. The workflow is set to `workflow_dispatch:`
only — it does **not** run on push. This path is **optional** and useful if you
mirror this repo to another host (e.g. GitLab) or prefer keeping deployments
self-contained in GitHub Actions instead of relying on Supabase's integration.

## WhatsApp integration

To connect your OpenBSP project to the WhatsApp API, you'll need to setup a Meta
App with the WhatsApp product and configure the following Edge Functions
secrets. You can set these up in two ways:

- **Direct configuration**: Add them directly in your Supabase dashboard at
  Supabase > Project > Edge Functions > Secrets.
  <!-- `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/{project_id}/functions/secrets` -->
- **GitHub Actions**: Set them as GitHub Actions secrets in your repository
  settings and re-run the _Release_ action to automatically deploy them.

#### Secrets

- **META_SYSTEM_USER_ID**
- **META_SYSTEM_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN**
- **META_APP_ID**
- **META_APP_SECRET**
- **WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN**

Follow these steps to obtain the required credentials.

<details>
<summary>
Step 0: Overview
</summary>

There is quiet a Meta nomenclature of entities that you might want to get in
order to not to get lost in the platform.

- **Business profile** - This is the top-level entity, represents a business.
  Has users and assets.
- **User** - Real or system users. System users can have access tokens. Users
  belong to a business portfolio and can have assigned assets.
- **Asset** - WhatsApp accounts, Instagram accounts, Meta apps, among others.
  Assets belong to a business portfolio and are assigned to users.
- **App** - An asset that integrates Meta products such as the WhatsApp Cloud
  API.
- **WhatsApp Business Account (WABA)** - A WhatsApp account asset, can have many
  phone numbers.
- **Phone number** - A registered phone number within the WhatsApp Cloud API.
  Belongs to a WABA.

<details>
<summary>
Step 4: Configure the WhatsApp Business Account webhook
</summary>

### Part A

1. Within the App Dashboard
2. Go to WhatsApp > Configuration
   <!-- `https://developers.facebook.com/apps/{app_id}/whatsapp-business/wa-settings` -->
3. Set the **Callback URL** to:
   `https://{SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID}.supabase.co/functions/v1/whatsapp-webhook`
4. Choose a secure token for **WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN** → Set it as the **Verify
   token**, but **do not** click **Verify and save** yet!
5. Ensure your Edge Functions environment variables are up-to-date
   - If you configured secrets directly in your Supabase dashboard, no further
     action is needed at this point
   - If you set secrets via GitHub Actions, re-run the _Release_ action now to
     deploy them to your Edge Functions
6. Click **Verify and save**
7. Disregard the screen that appears next and proceed to the next step

> Multiple Meta apps are supported by appending the query param
> `?app_id={META_APP_ID}` to the callback URL. For example:
> `https://{SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID}.supabase.co/functions/v1/whatsapp-webhook?app_id=app_id_2`.

### Part B

1. Within the App Dashboard
2. Go to WhatsApp > Configuration
   <!-- `https://developers.facebook.com/apps/{app_id}/whatsapp-business/wa-settings` -->

   - `messages`
   - `history`
   - `smb_app_state_sync`
   - `smb_message_echoes`

> Optionally, test the configuration so far. In the `messages` subscription
> section, click **Test**. You should see the request in Supabase > Project >
> Edge Functions > Functions > whatsapp-webhook > Logs.
>
> <!-- `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/{project_id}/functions/whatsapp-webhook/logs` -->
>
> You might observe an error in the logs. This is an expected outcome at this
> stage; the simple fact that a log entry appears confirms that the webhook is
> successfully receiving events.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Step 5: Add a phone number
</summary>

If you decide to add the **test number**,

1. Within the App Dashboard
2. Go to WhatsApp > API Setup
   <!-- `https://developers.facebook.com/apps/{app_id}/whatsapp-business/wa-dev-console` -->
3. Click **Generate access token** (you can't use the one you got from step 2
   here)
4. Copy these values:
   - **Phone number ID**
   - **WhatsApp Business Account ID**
5. Select a recipient phone number
6. Send messages with the API > **Send message**

> The test number doesn't seem to fully activate to receive messages unless you
> send a test message at least once.

In order to add a **production number**,

1. Click **Add phone number**
2. Follow the flow
3. Navigate to
   [WhatsApp Manager](https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/overview)
4. Go to Account tools > Phone numbers
   <!-- `https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/phone_numbers` -->
5. Copy these values:
   - **Phone number ID**
   - **WhatsApp Business Account ID**

### For any number you add

Create an organization if you haven't done that already.

```sql
insert into public.organizations (name, extra) values
  ('Default', '{ "response_delay_seconds": 0 }')
;
```

Note the **organization ID**.

Register the phone number with your organization in the system.

```sql
insert into public.organizations_addresses (address, organization_id, service, extra) values
  ('<Phone number ID>', '<Organization ID>', 'whatsapp', '{ "waba_id": "<WhatsApp Business Account ID>", "phone_number": "<Phone number>" }')
;
```

</details>

## Architecture

New to Supabase? In one sentence: it's a hosted Postgres platform that
auto-exposes your tables over a REST and realtime API, runs Deno-based Edge
Functions for server-side logic, and handles auth and file storage on top.
OpenBSP leans heavily on those primitives — most business logic lives as SQL
triggers and Edge Functions, and clients (the web UI, the Claude Code plugin,
custom integrations) talk to Postgres directly through a
[Supabase client library](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/rest/client-libs)
rather than through a separate backend layer.

<img src="./architecture.png" alt="Architecture diagram" width="600">

In the image, green boxes are external services, red are Edge Functions and
blue, database tables. White boxes are clients.

The system uses a reactive, function-based architecture:

1. A request from the WhatsApp API is received by the `whatsapp-webhook`
   function.
2. `whatsapp-webhook` processes the incoming message and stores it in the
   `messages` table.
3. An insert trigger on the `messages` table forwards the message to the
   `agent-client` function (incoming trigger).
4. `agent-client` builds the conversation context and sends a request to an
   agent API using the
   [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)
   format.
5. `agent-client` waits for the agent's response and saves it back to the
   `messages` table.
6. An outgoing trigger on the `messages` table forwards the new message to the
   `whatsapp-dispatcher` function.
7. `whatsapp-dispatcher` processes the message and sends a request to the
   WhatsApp API to deliver it.

This event-driven flow ensures that each component is decoupled and scalable.

### Edge Functions

#### WhatsApp

- `whatsapp-webhook`: Handles incoming webhook events from the
  [WhatsApp Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api).
- `whatsapp-dispatcher`: Sends outbound messages to the WhatsApp Cloud API.
- `whatsapp-manager`: Integrates with the
  [WhatsApp Business Management API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api)
  for business and phone number management.

#### Agent

- `agent-client`: Orchestrates agent interactions, builds conversation context,
  and communicates with external agent APIs over
  [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) or
  [A2A](https://github.com/google/A2A) protocols.

### Database models

- **users**: Registered user in the application (mapped to Supabase Auth).
- **organizations**: Tenant entity; holds organization metadata.
- **organizations_addresses**: An organization's connected addresses per service
  — e.g. a WhatsApp phone number. Belongs to an `organization`.
- **contacts**: People associated with an `organization` — the address-book
  entry that groups one or more addresses under a name.
- **contacts_addresses**: Addresses a contact can be reached at (e.g. a phone
  number for WhatsApp). An address can exist unlinked to any contact, so
  addresses and contacts have independent lifecycles — the sync triggers in this
  table manage linking/unlinking and orphan cleanup.
- **conversations**: A conversation between an `organization_address` and a
  `contact_address` (or `group_address`) for a given service; belongs to an
  `organization`.
- **messages**: Messages within a `conversation`; carry direction, type,
  payload, status, and timestamps.
- **agents**: Human or AI agents for an `organization`; optionally linked to an
  auth `user`.
- **api_keys**: API access keys scoped to an `organization`.
- **webhooks**: Outbound webhook subscriptions per `organization`.
- **quick_replies**: Reusable response snippets scoped to an `organization`.
- **logs**: Application-level log entries (errors, warnings) written by Edge
  Functions.

## Configuration

### Organizations

```ts
export type OrganizationExtra = {
  response_delay_seconds?: number; // default: 3
  welcome_message?: string;
  authorized_contacts_only?: boolean;
